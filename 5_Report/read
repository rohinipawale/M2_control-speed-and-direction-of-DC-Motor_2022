DC motor speed and direction control with a potentiometer
In this project, you will learn how to control the speed and direction of spin of the DC 
motor's rotor. You will use a potentiometer to provide input to the atmega328, and the 
map() and analogWrite() functions in your sketch to make this work.
In Project you will  learn how to control  DC motors with an  atmega328 and an 
BJT motor driver. You will learn how to control the speed and the direction of the two 
motors. In the role of the user interfaceyou will use a 10 kΩ potentiometer.

You will use the potentiometer in two ways:
First, you will use the potentiometer to control the speed of the motors, but not the 
direction.
Second, you will use the potentiometer to control both the speed and the direction o the 
motors.
The project  components
Two 5V DC motors. 
An atmega328 microcontroller.
4 PNP BJT.
 batteries.
A bunch of jumper wires.
A 10 kΩ potentiometer.

connection:
Connect the first motor to motor controller module Out1 and Out2. The order does not matter.
Connect the first motor to motor controller module Out3 and Out4. The order does not matter.
Connect the positive wire from the battery pack to pin +12V on the module.
Connect the negative wire from the battery pack to pin GND on the module.
Connect the GND pin of the module to the GND pin of the microcontroller.
Connect Atmega328 pin C1 to BJT 1 base and BJT4 base terminal.
Connect Atmega328 pin C0 to BJT 2 base and BJT3 base terminal.
Connect BJT1 emitter to BJT4 emitter termal. 
Connect BJT1 emitter to BJT4 emitter termal.
Connect BJT1 collector to BJT2 emiiter.
Connect BJT3 collector to BJT4 emiiter.
Connect BJT2 collector to BJT4 collector.
connect pull up switch to d1 and d2 pin.
Connect the other two pins of the potentiometer to microcontroller 5V and GND.
Inspect the wiring and ensure they are correct.
control speed and direction with a potentiometer
There’s one more thing to do, and that is to also be able to control the direction of 
rotation of the motors, not just the speed. What I’d like to do is to be able to accelerate 
the motor towards one direction when I turn the knob of the potentiometer towards the 
left, and to the opposite direction when I turn the knob towards the right.
